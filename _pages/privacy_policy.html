title: System Tester Chrome Extension Privacy Policy
permalink: /privacy-policy/
---

<p>
The System Tester Chrome Extension (the “Extension”) is developed and maintained by Richard LaFranchi (I, we, us).
This privacy policy was last updated on July 22, 2017.
</p>

<h2>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>

<p>
We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information as a result of using the Extension.
If we are contacted for support or questions related to the Extension, we will keep a users email for
future correspondence purposes.
</p>

<h2>Google Services</h2>

<p>
The Extension is offered on a subscription basis through the Chrome Web Store.  This requires the Extension to use the
Google Identity API and The Chrome Web Store API to verify a users subscription.  We may view anonymous
statistics and usage related to said APIs.  We are not responsible for the data that Google collects on its users,
so please refer to Google’s privacy policies related to these services.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
The Extension only works in conjunction with the System Tester Ruby Gem (https://github.com/rlafranchi/system_tester)
which is open source and licensed under the MIT license.  By default, the System Tester Ruby Gem only allows CORS
(Cross Origin Requests) from the chrome extension origin of chrome-extension://ebpjncfolmfiiphibdajgblbchkklbcf
and http://localhost:8080 for development purposes.  This limits the possibility of other websites submitting
potentially harmful requests to a users local development server, but does not guarantee prevention of malicious
usage or activity especially if custom code is used to override the default settings in the System Tester Ruby Gem.
</p>

<p>
The Extension is also allowed to inject a content script only on tabs using the localhost domain.  The Extension does
not inject this script on normal websites that you browse.  The purpose of the script is to track events for the purpose
of creating system tests.
</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>
Any users of the Extension own all the data generated by the extension.
This data is not passed along to us or any third party service.
